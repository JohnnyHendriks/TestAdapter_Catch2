# Reference tests for the Test Adapter for Catch2

For the development of the **Test Adapter for Catch2** some Catch2 tests were created. Some of these tests are actually used in the unit tests for the different components of the **Test Adapter for Catch2**. Others are just used the manually check how the test adapter handles them. So expect many of the tests to be failing tests.

The solutions you find here is added specifically for use with the [walkthrough](../../Docs/Walkthrough.md). Note two solutions are provided, one for use with Visual Studio 2017 and one for use with Visual Studio 2019. The name of the solution should give you a hint which solution is meant for which Visual Studio Version. Note that the walkthrough was made with Visual Studio 2017. In Visual Studio 2019 the Test Explorer has undergone a facelift and things work slightly different.

**Warning: the written tests do not necessarily follow best practices.**
