# Reference tests for the Test Adapter for Catch2

For the development of the **Test Adapter for Catch2** some Catch2 tests were created. Some of these tests are actually used in the unit tests for the different components of the **Test Adapter for Catch2**. Others are just used the manually check how the test adapter handles them. So expect many of the tests to be failing tests.

The solutions you find here were added specifically for use with the [walkthrough VS2022](../../Docs/Walkthrough-vs2022.md), [walkthrough VS2019](../../Docs/Walkthrough-vs2019.md), and [walkthrough VS2017](../../Docs/Walkthrough-vs2017.md). Note three solutions are provided, one for each specific Visual Studio version. The name of the solution should give you a hint which solution is meant for which Visual Studio Version.

**Warning: the written tests do not necessarily follow best practices.**
